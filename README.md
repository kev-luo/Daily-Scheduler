## Description

Using the jQuery and Moment.js libraries eases the workload of manipulating the DOM, making the process a lot less tedious. In addition to shortening the process of creating elements, I was also able to implement additional functionalities to the scheduler that would otherwise have been much more difficult to do writing the javaScript myself. For instance, the each() function allowed me to loop through an object and return its keys and values if needed. This was utilized in creating each row's time blocks. The each() function also allowed me to loop through specific elements, which is how I color coded each textarea.

## Process

The anonymous function defined within updateTime displays the current date at the top of the page. This was a big help in familiarizing myself with the Moment.js library. Next I initialized the object numLetts, assigning it key/value pairs of the hours needed in the scheduler app. This object were used to create the HTML elements. 

In the next section of the script I used each() to loop through the numLetts object. For each of the key/value pairs I created the elements used to render one time block row. I used the keys to create ID's for each row, and the values+Moment.js to display the hours for each hour block.

The next step was color-coding each block. Using each() I looped through all the textareas. For each loop I retrieved an ID that corresponded to a key in the numLetts object, allowing me to input the key's matching value as a parameter to a Moment.js call. I compared the current time to the top of each hour so that the color would accurate down to the second. At the bottom of my script I called this function every second so that the page wouldn't have to be refreshed in order to stay up-to-date.

Finally, I applied a click event listener to all the buttons. This would save anything typed into the textarea into local storage, using the row's ID as the key. If the textarea was blank it would delete the corresponding key from local storage. Again using each() the script loops through all textareas to retrieve and display text from local storage - this occurs when the page loads.

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
You'll need to use the Moment.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

Pseudocoding
make rows

make rows responsive so that text doesn't overflow when window width is minimized

**make button responsive so that it doesn't stretch weirdly when window width is minimized**

display current day when planner is loaded - moment.js

color code time block to be responsive based on current time and the row time

## double check code for color coding based on time difference (updateColor variable)

**user won't have to delete the text then press save again to store the empty task list to local storage**

page reload should get items from local storage
