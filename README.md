Pseudocoding
### make rows
    make rows responsive so that text doesn't overflow when window width is minimized
    make button responsive so that it doesn't stretch weirdly when window width is minimized
display current day when planner is loaded - moment.js
color code time block to be responsive based on current time and the row time
save button 
    event listener to save text to local storage
    if you remove an item from text area it should also remove the item from local storage, that way the user won't have to delete the text then press save again to store the empty task list to local storage (better ux)
page reload should get items from local storage
